## Overview
**LinxHQ** is a **web link launcher** designed specifically for **Android-based car tablets** (like those running Android Auto or custom ROMs).  
Many car-mounted tablets restrict users from saving shortcuts, adding PWAs, or pinning websites to the home screen. **LinxHQ solves that.**

With a clean, car-optimised interface, you can create and launch custom website links just like apps—complete with icons, names, and simple navigation.

## Features
- **Create Custom Web Shortcuts** – Add any website you like, give it a name, and assign a custom icon.
- **Car-Optimised UI** – Built with large touch targets and a clean interface for in-car use.
- **Quick Launch** – Tap your link, and you're instantly taken to the website in your browser.
- **No Root Required** – Works on locked-down systems where default launchers restrict customisation.
- **Persistent List** – Your added links are saved and can be accessed anytime.
- **Offline-Friendly** – App doesn't require constant internet access once set up.
